    "description": "The history of La Tour Carnet is inextricably linked with that of France. The name of the property, for instance, comes from the name of the estate’s horseman who unfailingly aided his master to fight off French royalty at the end of the One Hundred Years War. Then, after having played a major role in the revolution of the Médoc vineyard, La Tour Carnet was duly recognised for the quality of its wine, when the estate was ranked in the 1855 classification of Grands Crus. The diversity of its terroir on the one hand, and the constant search for perfection on the other, have made this Haut-Médoc an outstanding growth."
